# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
This repository contains the implementation of a K-Means Clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The clustering is performed on the 'Annual Income' and 'Spending Score' features of the customers.

## Program Overview
The Python program uses the KMeans algorithm from the scikit-learn library to cluster customers. The process involves loading the dataset, visualizing the distribution of features, determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method, and finally, visualizing the clustered customers.

## Dataset
The program utilizes the 'Mall_Customers.csv' dataset, which contains information about customers, including their age, annual income, and spending score.

## Usage
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using:
-pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
-Run the Jupyter Notebook containing the program of Task-2.ipynb file.
-Follow the step-by-step guide to load the dataset, explore data distribution, and perform K-Means Clustering.

## Files
Task-2.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the K-Means Clustering implementation.
Mall_Customers.csv: Dataset containing customer information.

## Visualizations
The program generates visualizations, including distribution plots and scatter plots, to help understand the characteristics of the dataset and the clustering results.

## Clustering Results
The clustered customers are visualized in a scatter plot with different colors representing different clusters. Centroids are also marked for each cluster.
