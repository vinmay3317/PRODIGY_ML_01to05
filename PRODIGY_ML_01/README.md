# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms. The model is built using Python and the scikit-learn library.

## Files
PRODIGY_ML_01.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of Linear Regression for house price prediction.
dataset.csv: Sample dataset containing information about houses, including square footage, the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, and the corresponding prices.

## Installation
To run the notebook, make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries.

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook PRODIGY_ML_01.ipynb.
Load and explore the provided dataset (dataset.csv).
Follow the step-by-step guide to preprocess the data, train the Linear Regression model, and make predictions.
Provide the required input features (square footage, the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms) for house price predictions.

## Dataset
The provided dataset (dataset.csv) contains the following columns:

SquareFootage: Square footage of the house.
Bedrooms: Number of bedrooms in the house.
Bathrooms: Number of bathrooms in the house.
Price: Price of the house.
Feel free to replace this dataset with your own dataset if needed.
